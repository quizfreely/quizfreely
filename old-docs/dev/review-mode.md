## Term States

Each terms has a "state" that determines how often it's shown and what effect changes in accuracy has on it's frequency and stuff. 

These states are "new", "learning", "in review", or "relearning".

![diagram showing term states; new/unreviewed terms become "learning" state terms which become "in review" after reaching a certain accuracy and number of review sessions, terms in review stay in review except when their accuracy decreases and they become "relearning" state terms which can then go back to "in review" state after increasing accuracy again](./review-mode-term-state-diagram.png)

Term states are seperate for each terms' term and definition.
